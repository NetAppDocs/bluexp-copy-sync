=== Sorting in the dashboard

You now sort the dashboard by sync relationship name.

=== Enhancement to Data Sense integration

In the previous release, we introduced Cloud Sync integration with Cloud Data Sense. In this update, we enhanced the integration by making it easier to create the sync relationship. After you initiate a data sync from Cloud Data Sense, all of the source information is contained in a single step and only requires you to enter a few key details.

== 06 Feb 2022

=== Enhancement to data broker groups

We changed how you interact with data brokers by emphasizing data broker _groups_.

For example, when you create a new sync relationship, you select the data broker _group_ to use with the relationship, rather than a specific data broker.

image:screenshot-sync-select-data-broker-group.png[A screenshot of the Sync Relationship wizard that shows the data broker group selection.]

In the *Manage Data Brokers* tab, we also show the number of sync relationships that a data broker group is managing.

=== Download PDF reports

You can now download a PDF of a report.

=== New Box sync relationships

Two new sync relationships are supported:

* Box to Azure NetApp Files
* Box to Amazon FSx for ONTAP

link:reference_sync_requirements.html[View the complete list of supported sync relationships].

=== Relationship names

You can now provide a meaningful name to each of your sync relationships to more easily identify the purpose of each relationship. You can add the name when you create the relationship and any time after.

image:screenshot-sync-relationship-edit-name.png[A screenshot of a sync relationship that shows the edit button that's next to the name of a relationship.]

=== S3 private links

When you sync data to or from Amazon S3, you can choose whether to use an S3 private link. When the data broker copies data from the source to the target, it goes through the private link.

Note that the IAM role associated with your data broker will need the following permission to use this feature:

[source,json]
"ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints"

This permission is automatically added to any new data brokers that you create.

=== Glacier Instant Retrieval

You can now choose the _Glacier Instant Retrieval_ storage class when Amazon S3 is the target in a sync relationship.

=== ACLs from object storage to SMB shares

Cloud Sync now supports copying ACLs from object storage to SMB shares. Previously, we only supported copying ACLs from an SMB share to object storage.

=== SFTP to S3

Creating a sync relationship from SFTP to Amazon S3 is now supported in the user interface. This sync relationship was previously supported with the API only.

=== Table view enhancement

We redesigned the table view on the Dashboard for ease of use. If you click *More info*, Cloud Sync filters the dashboard to show you more information about that specific relationship.

=== Support for Jarkarta region

Cloud Sync now supports deploying the data broker in the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) region.

=== ACLs from SMB to object storage

Cloud Sync can now copy access control lists (ACLs) when setting up a sync relationship from a source SMB share to object storage (except for ONTAP S3).

Cloud Sync doesn't support copying ACLs from object storage to SMB shares.

link:task_sync_copying_acls.html[Learn how to copy ACLs from an SMB share].

=== Update credentials

Cloud Sync now enables you to update the data broker with the latest credentials of the source or target in an existing sync relationship.

This enhancement can help if your security policies require you to update credentials on a periodic basis. link:task_sync_managing_relationships.html[Learn how to update credentials].

image:screenshot_sync_update_credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the Update Credentials option on the Sync Relationships page just under the name of the source or target.]

=== Tags for object storage targets

Adding tags is supported with Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, IBM Cloud Object Storage, and StorageGRID.

link:task_sync_installing_gcp.html[Learn how to deploy a data broker in Google Cloud].

=== Dual-protocol volume for Azure NetApp Files

When you choose the source or target volume for Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Sync now displays a dual-protocol volume no matter which protocol you chose for the sync relationship.

== 07 July 2021

=== ONTAP S3 Storage and Google Cloud Storage

Cloud Sync now supports sync relationships between ONTAP S3 Storage and a Google Cloud Storage bucket from the user interface.

link:task_sync_creating_relationships.html#settings[Learn more about the Copy for Objects setting].

=== Support for HashiCorp Vaults

You can now set up the data broker to access credentials from an external HashiCorp Vault by authenticating with a Google Cloud service account.

link:task_external_vault.html[Learn more about using a HashiCorp Vault with a data broker].

=== Define tags or metadata for S3 bucket

When setting up a sync relationship to an Amazon S3 bucket, the Sync Relationship wizard now enables you to define the tags or metadata that you want to save on the objects in the target S3 bucket.

The tagging option was previously part of the sync relationship's settings.

== 07 June 2021

=== Storage classes in Google Cloud

When a Google Cloud Storage bucket is the target in a sync relationship, you can now choose the storage class that you want to use. Cloud Sync supports the following storage classes:

The standalone Cloud Sync service has been retired. You should now access Cloud Sync directly from Cloud Manager where all of the same features and functionality are available.

After logging in to Cloud Manager, you can switch to the Sync tab at the top and view your relationships, just like before.

=== Google Cloud buckets in different projects

When setting up a sync relationship, you can choose from Google Cloud buckets in different projects, if you provide the required permissions to the data broker's service account.

link:task_sync_installing_gcp.html[Learn how to set up the service account].

=== Metadata between Google Cloud Storage and S3

Cloud Sync now copies metadata between Google Cloud Storage and S3 providers (AWS S3, StorageGRID, and IBM Cloud Object Storage).
