== 3 July 2022

=== Support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

You can now sync data from an NFS server or SMB server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

When creating a sync relationship that includes Azure Data Lake, you need to provide Cloud Sync with the storage account connection string. It must be a regular connection string, not a shared access signature (SAS).

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/reference-supported-relationships.html[View the list of supported sync relationships].

=== Continuous sync from Google Cloud Storage

The Continuous Sync setting is now supported from a source Google Cloud Storage bucket to a cloud storage target.

After the initial data sync, Cloud Sync listens for changes on the source Google Cloud Storage bucket and continuously syncs any changes to the target as they occur. This setting is available when syncing from a Google Cloud Storage bucket to S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob storage, StorageGRID, or IBM Storage.

The service account associated with your data broker needs the following permissions to use this setting:

[source,json]
- pubsub.subscriptions.consume
- pubsub.subscriptions.create
- pubsub.subscriptions.delete
- pubsub.subscriptions.list
- pubsub.topics.attachSubscription
- pubsub.topics.create
- pubsub.topics.delete
- pubsub.topics.list
- pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy
- storage.buckets.update

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/task-creating-relationships.html#settings[Learn more about the Continuous Sync setting].

=== New Google Cloud region support

The Cloud Sync data broker is now supported in the following Google Cloud regions:

* Columbus (us-east5)
* Dallas (us-south1)
* Madrid (europe-southwest1)
* Milan (europe-west8)
* Paris (europe-west9)

=== New Google Cloud machine type

The default machine type for the data broker in Google Cloud is now n2-standard-4.

== 6 June 2022

=== Continuous sync

A new setting enables you to continuously sync changes from a source S3 bucket to a target.

After the initial data sync, Cloud Sync listens for changes on the source S3 bucket and continuously syncs any changes to the target as they occur. There's no need to rescan the source at scheduled intervals. This setting is available only when syncing from an S3 bucket to S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob storage, StorageGRID, or IBM Storage.

Note that the IAM role associated with your data broker will need the following permissions to use this setting:

[source,json]
"s3:GetBucketNotification",
"s3:PutBucketNotification"

These permissions are automatically added to any new data brokers that you create.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/task-creating-relationships.html#settings[Learn more about the Continuous Sync setting].

=== Show all ONTAP volumes

When you create a sync relationship, Cloud Sync now displays all volumes on a source Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, on-premises ONTAP cluster, or FSx for ONTAP file system.

Previously, Cloud Sync would only display the volumes that matched the selected protocol. Now all of the volumes display, but any volumes that don't match the selected protocol or that don't have a share or export are greyed out and not selectable.

=== Copying tags to Azure Blob

When you create a sync relationship where Azure Blob is the target, Cloud Sync now enables you to copy tags to the Azure Blob container:

* On the *Settings* page, you can use the *Copy for Objects* setting to copy tags from the source to the Azure Blob container. This is in addition to copying metadata.

* On the *Tags/Metadata* page, you can specify Blob index tags to set on the objects that are copied to the Azure Blob container. Previously, you could only specify relationship metadata.

These options are supported when Azure Blob is the target and the source is either Azure Blob or an S3-compatible endpoint (S3, StorageGRID, or IBM Cloud Object Storage).

== 1 May 2022

=== Sync timeout

A new *Sync Timeout* setting is now available for sync relationships. This setting enables you to define whether Cloud Sync should cancel a data sync if the sync hasn't completed in the specified number of hours or days.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/task-managing-relationships.html#changing-the-settings-for-a-sync-relationship[Learn more about changing the settings for a sync relationship].

=== Notifications

A new *Notifications* setting is now available for sync relationships. This setting enables you to choose whether to receive Cloud Sync notifications in Cloud Manager's Notification Center. You can enable notifications for successful data syncs, failed data syncs, and canceled data syncs.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-sync/main/media/screenshot-notification-center.png[A screenshot that shows the Notification Center in Cloud Manager.]

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/task-managing-relationships.html#changing-the-settings-for-a-sync-relationship[Learn more about changing the settings for a sync relationship].

== 3 April 2022

=== Data broker group enhancements

We made several enhancements to data broker groups:

* You can now move a data broker to a new or existing group.

* You can now update the proxy configuration for a data broker.

* Finally, you can also delete data broker groups.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-sync/task-managing-data-brokers.html[Learn how to manage data broker groups].

=== Dashboard filter

You can now filter the contents of the Sync Dashboard to more easily find sync relationships that match a certain status. For example, you can filter on sync relationships that have a failed status

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-sync/main/media/screenshot-sync-filter.png[A screenshot that shows the Filter by sync status option at the top of the dashboard.]
// end::whats-new[]

You now sort the dashboard by sync relationship name.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-sync/main/media/screenshot-sync-sort.png[A screenshot that shows the Sort by name option that is available from the dashboard.]

=== Enhancement to Data Sense integration

In the previous release, we introduced Cloud Sync integration with Cloud Data Sense. In this update, we enhanced the integration by making it easier to create the sync relationship. After you initiate a data sync from Cloud Data Sense, all of the source information is contained in a single step and only requires you to enter a few key details.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-sync/main/media/screenshot-sync-data-sense.png[A screenshot that shows the Data Sense Integration page that appears after starting a new sync directly from Cloud Data Sense.]

== 6 February 2022

=== Enhancement to data broker groups

We changed how you interact with data brokers by emphasizing data broker _groups_.

For example, when you create a new sync relationship, you select the data broker _group_ to use with the relationship, rather than a specific data broker.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-sync/main/media/screenshot-sync-select-data-broker-group.png[A screenshot of the Sync Relationship wizard that shows the data broker group selection.]

In the *Manage Data Brokers* tab, we also show the number of sync relationships that a data broker group is managing.

link:reference-supported-relationships.html[View the list of supported sync relationships].

=== Relationship names

You can now provide a meaningful name to each of your sync relationships to more easily identify the purpose of each relationship. You can add the name when you create the relationship and any time after.

image:screenshot-sync-relationship-edit-name.png[A screenshot of a sync relationship that shows the edit button that's next to the name of a relationship.]

=== S3 private links

When you sync data to or from Amazon S3, you can choose whether to use an S3 private link. When the data broker copies data from the source to the target, it goes through the private link.

Note that the IAM role associated with your data broker will need the following permission to use this feature:

[source,json]
"ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints"

This permission is automatically added to any new data brokers that you create.

=== Glacier Instant Retrieval

You can now choose the _Glacier Instant Retrieval_ storage class when Amazon S3 is the target in a sync relationship.

=== ACLs from object storage to SMB shares

Cloud Sync now supports copying ACLs from object storage to SMB shares. Previously, we only supported copying ACLs from an SMB share to object storage.

=== SFTP to S3

Creating a sync relationship from SFTP to Amazon S3 is now supported in the user interface. This sync relationship was previously supported with the API only.

=== Table view enhancement

We redesigned the table view on the Dashboard for ease of use. If you click *More info*, Cloud Sync filters the dashboard to show you more information about that specific relationship.
