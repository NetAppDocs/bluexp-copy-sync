The NetApp Cloud Sync service offers a simple, secure, and automated way to migrate your data to any target, in the cloud or on your premises. Whether it’s a file-based NAS dataset (NFS or SMB), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) object format, a NetApp StorageGRID® appliance, or any other cloud provider object store, Cloud Sync can convert and move it for you.

== Features

== How Cloud Sync works

Cloud Sync is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that consists of a data broker group, a cloud-based interface available through BlueXP, and a source and target.

The following image shows the relationship between Cloud Sync components:

The NetApp data broker software syncs data from a source to a target (this is called a _sync relationship_). You can run the data broker in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on your premises. A data broker group, which consists of one or more data brokers, needs an outbound internet connection over port 443 so it can communicate with the Cloud Sync service and contact a few other services and repositories. link:reference-networking.html[View the list of endpoints].

After the initial copy, the service syncs any changed data based on the schedule that you set.

== Costs

There are two types of costs associated with using Cloud Sync: resource charges and service charges.

Resource charges:: Resource charges are related to the compute and storage costs for running one or more data brokers in the cloud.

Service charges:: There are two ways to pay for sync relationships after your 14-day free trial ends. The first option is to subscribe from AWS or Azure, which enables you to pay hourly or annually. The second option is to purchase licenses directly from NetApp.
