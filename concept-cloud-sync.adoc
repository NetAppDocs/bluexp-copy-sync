== How BlueXP copy and sync works

BlueXP copy and sync is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that consists of a data broker group, a cloud-based interface available through BlueXP, and a source and target.

The following image shows the relationship between BlueXP copy and sync components:

The NetApp data broker software syncs data from a source to a target (this is called a _sync relationship_). You can run the data broker in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on your premises. A data broker group, which consists of one or more data brokers, needs an outbound internet connection over port 443 so it can communicate with the BlueXP copy and sync service and contact a few other services and repositories. link:reference-networking.html[View the list of endpoints].

After the initial copy, the service syncs any changed data based on the schedule that you set.

== Costs

There are two types of costs associated with using BlueXP copy and sync: resource charges and service charges.

Resource charges:: Resource charges are related to the compute and storage costs for running one or more data brokers in the cloud.

Service charges:: There are two ways to pay for sync relationships after your 14-day free trial ends. The first option is to subscribe from AWS or Azure, which enables you to pay hourly or annually. The second option is to purchase licenses directly from NetApp.
